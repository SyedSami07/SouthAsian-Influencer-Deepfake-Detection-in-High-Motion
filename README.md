DeepDance-Detection: Deepfake Detection in Dance Videos📌 Project OverviewThis repository contains the source code and research methodology for detecting deepfakes specifically in dance videos. Dance videos present a unique challenge for deepfake detection due to rapid body movements, complex lighting, and motion blur. Our research evaluates multiple Deep Learning architectures to find the most robust solution for this domain.📊 Research HighlightsTarget: Binary classification of Dance Videos (Real vs. AI-Generated).Best Model: ResNet50 (Transfer Learning).Max Accuracy: 77.65%.Key Techniques: Class Weighting, High Dropout (0.7), and Video-wise Data Splitting to prevent data leakage.📁 Dataset SpecificationWe curated a specialized dataset focusing on high-motion dance performances.Videos: 155 Total (89 AI-generated, 66 Real).Frames: 12,308 total extracted frames (80 frames per video).Preprocessing: All frames resized to $224 \times 224$ and normalized.Class Distribution: * AI-Generated: 7,120 framesReal: 5,188 frames🚀 Model ComparisonWe conducted a comparative study between three state-of-the-art CNN architectures:ArchitectureValidation AccuracyF1-Score (AI)ResNet5077.65%0.63Xception74.80%0.61MobileNetV272.95%0.58🛠️ Installation & UsageClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/DeepDance-Detection.git

Model Performance Comparison2. Confusion Matrix (ResNet50)🧪 Results DiscussionThe model demonstrates high proficiency in detecting AI-generated artifacts. However, "Real" videos with high-velocity movements sometimes mimic deepfake distortions, leading to a higher false-positive rate. By applying Class Weights (1.0 for AI, 1.5 for Real), we significantly stabilized the training process.📜 LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.🤝 ContributingContributions are welcome!
